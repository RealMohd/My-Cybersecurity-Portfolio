# Defensive Security Intro
>TryHackMe | Room 2

---

##  General Information
- **Platform**: TryHackMe
- **Difficulty Level**: Easy
- **Date**: 30 July 2025
- **Security Software**: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

---

## Objective
- Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM.

---

## Steps

### 1. **Understanding Defensive Security** 
>Learned that defensive security focuses on:
- Preventing intrusions
- Detecting and responding to intrusions

>Explored roles like Blue Teams and their responsibilities, including:
- User awareness training
- Asset management
- System patching
- Firewall/IPS setup
- Logging and monitoring

### 2. **Areas of Defensive Security**
>Studied key components:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
    -Monitors networks/systems
    -Responds to vulnerabilities, policy violations, and unauthorized activities
    -Uses Threat Intelligence to gather and analyze data about potential threats
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
    -Involves:
        -Digital Forensics: Investigating logs, memory, storage
        -Incident Response: Steps taken during and after an incident
        -Malware Analysis: Analyzing malware statically and dynamically

### 3. **Simulation with SIEM**
- Used simulated SIEM environment 
- Investigated alerts such as:
    -Multiple failed login attempts
    -Connections from unknown IPs

- Used analytical skills to distinguish between:
    -Multiple failed login attempts
    -Connections from unknown IPs

- Used analytical skills to distinguish between:
    -False positives (user mistyping password)
    -Real threats (unauthorized IP activity)

- Located and copied the flag in the format THM{...}

## Notes
> Defensive Security â€“ Notes

-Overview  
    -Focus: Preventing and detecting/responding to cyber attacks.
    -Handled by Blue Teams (vs. Red Teams for offensive security).

> Key Defensive Tasks

-User Awareness â€“ Training users on security best practices.
-Asset Management â€“ Tracking systems and software.
-Patching â€“ Fixing known vulnerabilities.
-Firewalls & IPS â€“ Controlling and blocking malicious traffic.
-Logging & Monitoring â€“ Detecting unusual or unauthorized activity.

> Security Operations Center (SOC)

 - Monitors networks and systems for:
 -Vulnerabilities
 -Policy violations
 -Unauthorized access
 -Intrusions

- Threat Intelligence
    -Gathers and analyzes threat data.
    -Sources: internal logs & public info.
    -Helps predict and mitigate attacks.

> DFIR â€“ Digital Forensics & Incident Response

- Digital Forensics
    -Analyzes: File systems,Memory dumps, System & network logs

> Incident Response Phases

1. Preparation â€“ Tools and plans in place
2. Detection & Analysis â€“ Identify and assess incidents
3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery â€“ Stop, remove, and restore
4. Post-Incident â€“ Review and improve

> Malware Analysis

- Virus â€“ Attaches to programs and spreads
- Trojan Horse â€“ Disguised as legitimate software
- Ransomware â€“ Encrypts files, demands payment

- Methods:
    Static Analysis â€“ Review without running
    Dynamic Analysis â€“ Run in safe environment, observe behavior

> SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

- Collects security logs from multiple sources
- Alerts analysts to suspicious activity
- Analysts investigate and respond to real threats
