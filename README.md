Welcome to my personal cybersecurity portfolio.  
This repository documents my journey in ethical hacking and penetration testing.  
I showcase my technical notes, lab reports, bug bounty progress, and overall learning — written and organized to reflect my growth, mindset, and career goals in cybersecurity.

## About Me

- I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student.
- Passionate about cybersecurity with a clear focus on penetration testing and red teaming.
- Long-term goal: Join a red team at a reputable organization (remotely or on-site).
- Committed to consistency - I dedicate at least one hour daily, no matter how busy life gets.
- I document my journey bot just to learn deeply, but also to build credibility in the field.
